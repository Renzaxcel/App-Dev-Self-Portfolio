    <p class="description">
        Good day! I am Renz Axcel Elicana from BSIT 2E .  am currently a second-year Information Technology student. I am passionate about technology and its potential to change the world, which is why I chose to pursue this field of study.
      Coding and programming are a significant part of my course, and while I wouldn't say I'm an expert at it, I truly enjoy the process of learning. I find it both challenging and rewarding to solve problems and create solutions using code. Each line of code I write, each function I create, and each program I build brings me closer to understanding this vast and exciting field.
      I believe that learning is a journey, and every step, no matter how small, is progress. Thank you!</p>
